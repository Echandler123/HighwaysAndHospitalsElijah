I also added the variables I know I need. I wrote the test case for when hospitals are less than the roads because then you will just build hospitals everywhere. |

I do not know how to find the number of clusters yet though. | 
| sept 12 |  8:55 am - 9:25am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I made 2 for loops to try and find the number of clusters and printed out the amount it found. I realised that when a number showed up multiple times it would affect the number of cluster counted making it inaccurate, so I added if statements and a third for loop to and fix that |
| sept 21 | 10:00pm - 10:30 pm | I used the union find pseudocode to write my algorithm. I started by adding the cas of the hospitals being less expensive so its just n * the hospital cost. Then I created the array at the beginning where everything is its own root. Then I made a for loop that goes through the cities 2d array. In the fr loop I used while loops to check either city a or city b to see if they are there own root and if not then they are set as it in the roots array. Then the third while loop checks if city a equals city b and if not then the root of b is set to a. This was do to connect all the cities that were originally their own root into larger connected cities with one set root for each large city. |
| sept 21 |  10:30pm- 11:00pm  |              I then calculated the total cost if highways cost less then hospitals by counting the number of cities where their are their own root after the for loop has run meaning that this will count the roots of each larger city because the only cities that are their own root will be the ones that are the final roots of the large cities. I use this number to find the and multiply it by the hospital cost because I know it is the minimum number of hospital need. Then I added that value to the total number of cities in the beginning minus the unique ones times the highway cost as that will be the remaining number of highways need for all of the smaller cities that are now connected. |
