| Sept 11 | 11:00 - 11:30 pm  | I tried reading the problem and wirting out the example case given to understand the problem more. I also added the variables I know I need. I wrote the test case for when hospitals are less than the roads because then you will just build hospitals everywhere. |
| Sept 11 | 11:30pm - 12:00am |                              I first tried finding the cost by mutiplying the cost of hospitals by the number of clusters because each cluster needs 1 hospital if the hospital is more than the roads. I do not know how to find the number of clusters yet though. |
