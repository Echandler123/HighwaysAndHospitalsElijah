I also added the variables I know I need. I wrote the test case for when hospitals are less than the roads because then you will just build hospitals everywhere. |

I do not know how to find the number of clusters yet though. |

I realised that when a number showed up mutiple times it owuld affect the number of cluster counted making it inaccurate, so I added if statements and a third for loop to and fix that |
